        <p> Science has enabled record-breaking advancement. Achievable levels of detail,
            the excellence of a particular system, and the effectiveness of resources
            and tools within science all contribute to the establishment of boundaries.
            You now have quick access to a never-ending library of knowledge thanks to
            these rapid advancements. The vast amount of data that is available to users,
            however, makes it challenging to examine. In addition, some compression is 
            built-in and only needs a few artifacts
            to be accessible. As a result, when ideas are shared, quality is frequently
            compromised. Basically, it modifies the original language and runs or executes
            a set of instructions on an already-existing machine.
